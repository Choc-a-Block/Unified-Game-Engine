This project is to understand that core components to a game engine. This invloves the rendering piplines and physics engine.

This project will build a library that can be linked to by your compiler.

**Note: Currently the export is a exe due to the library being in ongoing development and not a relase stage**

## Installation and usage

This will compile the whole library:

**For the time being you will have to write your code in a forked project so that it may compile with the library*
